include: [clock-node.yaml]

properties:
  apbpre-loc:
    required: true
    type: array
    description: |
      APBPRE field corresponding to the bus on
      which this frequency multiplier is connected

      Three elements:
        [0]: RCC register address
        [1]: offset of configuration field
        [2]: size of configuration field

  timpre-loc:
    type: array
    description: |
      TIMPRE field in RCC

      Three elements:
        [0]: RCC register address
        [1]: offset of configuration field
        [2]: size of configuration field

      If this property is absent, a fixed 2x multiplication factor is assumed.
      If this property is present, the behavior depends on field size:
        - 1 bit: 2x if TIMPRE=0b0, 4x if TIMPRE=0b1
        - 2 bit: (to be supported)
