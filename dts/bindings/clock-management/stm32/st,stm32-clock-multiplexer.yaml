      Multiplexer inputs

      The index in this array corresponds to the value that must be programmed
      in the mux register field to select the source found at that index.

      For example, with `inputs = <&clk_a &no_clock &clk_b &clk_c>;`:
        * a value of 0 selects `clk_a`
        * a value of 1 selects no clock
        * a value of 2 selects `clk_b`
        * a value of 3 selects `clk_c`
