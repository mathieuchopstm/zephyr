  STM32 internal oscillator generator

  This compatible can be used directly for STM32 clock
  generators with fixed frequency and no configuration
  (e.g., HSI or LSI). The driver also supports HSE and
  LSE, but these sources should have their own compatible
  in first position, in addition to this one.

compatible: "st,stm32-internal-clkgen"

include: "st,stm32-clkgen-common.yaml"

properties:
  "#clock-cells":
    const: 1

clock-cells:
  - enable  # disable/enable generator
