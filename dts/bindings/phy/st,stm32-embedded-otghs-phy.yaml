      HS PHY clock configuration

      This is an array of two cells:
        - the first indicates the RCC bit enabling the PHY's clock
        - the second indicates the PHY clock mux configuration

      For example, on STM32H7R/S series:
        /*
         * RCC_AHB1ENR bit 26 = USBPHYCEN
         * RCC_CCIPR1 [13:12] = USBPHYCSEL
         */

        /* hse_ker_ck */
        clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK(AHB1, 26)>,
                 <&rcc STM32_SRC_HSE USBPHYC_SEL(0)>;

        /* (hse_ker_ck / 2) */
        clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK(AHB1, 26)>,
                 <&rcc (STM32_SRC_HSE | STM32_CLOCK_DIV(2)) USBPHYC_SEL(1)>;

        /* pll3_q_ck */
        clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK(AHB1, 26)>,
                 <&rcc STM32_SRC_HSE USBPHYC_SEL(0)>;

      Input frequency of HS PHY in MHz

      This should be determined based on the system's clock configuration.
