      Clock configuration of USBPHYC

      The first cell is mandatory and corresponds
      to the clock gate of the USBPHYC. The second
      cell is optional and corresponds to the mux
      configuration.

      For example, on STM32N6 series:
        clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK(AHB5, 27)>,
                 <&rcc STM32_SRC_HSE OTGPHY1CKREF_SEL(1)>;
